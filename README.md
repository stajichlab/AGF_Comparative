Neocallimastigomycota comparative genomics and phylogenomics
=======

Dataset archive for analysis of the divergence times of Neocallimastigomycota or Anaerobic Gut Fungi (AGF). The repository includes the scripts and configuration files needed to compute the analyses presented in the submitted manuscripts.

* Trinity derived protein sets from assembled RNAseq of 21 strains 
* Phylogenetic analysis of phylogenomic identification of conserved proteins
* Divergence time estimation
* Protein domain annotation 
* Analysis of identified Horizontal gene transfer candidates
